# **Portfolio Website**
I am creating a platform for myself to host the various types of work that I am doing for potential clients/employers. 

## **Objective(s)**
To create a functional and aesthetically pleasing website that:
- Demonstrates my skills
- Presents information about me (+ contact information)
- Hosts my work in an interactive manner

## **Getting Started**

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
